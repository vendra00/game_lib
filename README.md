# Game Library With Vaadin

Project Using Framework Vaadin utilizing only Java classes for the frontend side.

It is a game library using H2 Database, I provided a dummy data for better understanding. 
Just run the application, and it will lead you to the main page with you can add data manually.

To Run the application just build the project and let Maven build all dependencies. 
You will need Java 18 to run it.

Have Fun
